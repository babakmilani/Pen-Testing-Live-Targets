#PASSWORD ENUMERATION BLUE TARGET

testing all three target's login page I noticed a difference in the blue target error message.
After inspecting the page in firefox with a correct username / incorrect password, and 
incorrect username / incorrect password I saw a difference in the html class (failed/failure).
